 We will use ed discussion as our online "social" space. You can ask and answer questions, and discuss topics. If you have a question about anything in this course,
it is very likely that one of your classmates also has the exact same question.
In order to reduce the number of emails, and to form a learning community,
we will be using ed.
If you need to ask anything personal, please email me.
You always have the choice to post anoynmously and your classmates would not know who has written the post but I would know who you are.
Before you start writing your post,
please make sure to search first if the same question has already been posted.
Always follow online communication etiquette when posting on ed.
